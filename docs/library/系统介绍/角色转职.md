This page describes the character growth logic of all characters in MapleStory. In MapleStory, all characters will grow in power at a particular level, which will unlock the Job Advancement quest. The requirement of the quest depends on the job, while for a few jobs, job advancements are awarded automatically once the level is met without doing anything more.
